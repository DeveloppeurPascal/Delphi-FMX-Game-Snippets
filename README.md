# Delphi FMX Game Snippets

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Examples of what is done when developing video games: sprite management, background music, sound effects, animations, ...

Projects are developed under Delphi with its FireMonkey multiplatform framework to run our projects under Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux from the same code base.

Not all images and musics used in this repository are free of charge. Reuse them only if you have a license. They remain the property of their respective authors and are only present in the programs for demo purposes.

Images and sounds from:

* [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) which I thank for his work and spirit of sharing. Think of doing the same as me: support him by buying licenses of his creations if you use them even if he does not require us to.
* [The Game Creators](https://www.thegamecreators.com/), software editor for video game creation and games, also offers assets including a noise library used here.
* GSP 500 Noises, a CD-ROM of rights-free noise published in 1995. Yeah, I know, some of you weren't born... There was also a life before the Internet.
* [Cartoon Smart](https://vasur.fr/cartoonsmart) which offers video training in the development of video games for iOS and macOS with the possibility to download free sound and image libraries when you subscribe.

Information and explanations on the projects of this repository are available on [Developeur Pascal blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/).

Example projects are in the group fr.developeurpascal.demo.*

Please do not publish them on application stores or elsewhere in a compiled version but systematically [return to this code repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-FMX-Game-Snippets) or to [the dedicated section on the blog Developpeur Pascal](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/delphi-fmx-game-snippets.html).

This library was created [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) during the Gaming For Sidaction operation in favor of [Sidaction 2021](https://sidaction.org). You can view this weekend's replay on https://serialstreameur.fr/sidaction-2021.php

If you want to see the result of the animations in a real video game, take a look at [Ok Ducky](https://okducky.gamolf.fr/) developed live during this live game coding weekend.

Other games were developed throughout the year 2021 and beyond on Twitch. Reruns of these sessions are available on [Serial Streamer Video Games](https://serialstreameur.fr/games-video.php).

If you are looking for examples of code to learn Delphi about something other than video game or basic manipulations see [this repository of examples of all kinds](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples).And if not, take a look at [these open-source video games on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/delphi-game).

To code your own games in Delphi, there are numerous utilities and game engines. You'll find a few links on [Awesome Pascal](https://github.com/Fr0sT-Brutal/awesome-pascal#game-dev). You can also use FireMonkey natively and add just a few useful tricks with [Delphi Game Engine](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine).

This code repository contains some projects developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-FMX-Game-Snippets).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/Delphi-Game-Engine subfolder.
* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/librairies subfolder.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-FMX-Game-Snippets/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
